## Settings Videos
### Settings videos is actually quite simple! When settings videos, the player only uses id's at this time. You may set a start time just by stating ',(amountOfSeconds)'. Ex: EOtpmFTpgIE,30 to start it at 30 seconds. In the near future, I will add url's, but only https, others will throw an error, remove it from the array, and try to select a new one. Not changing the id's will use my default ones.
```
ytads.videos = ['EOtpmFTpgIE', '_2ob3sKqWV0,25'];
```
## Muting
### Muting is another simple thing, by default, muting is true. This only works when the cover (from controlling user interaction) is set to true. Muting allows the user to mute and unmute the ads.
### To set muting allowed
```
ytads.settings.canMute = true;
```
### Otherwise use
```
ytads.settings.canMute = false;
```
## Controlling User Interaction
### When showing a YouTube ad, we may not want to allow them to change the current time, or even pause it.
### To disable YouTube controls
```
ytads.settings.cover = true;
```
### Otherwise use
```
ytads.settings.cover = false;
```
